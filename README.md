## Architecture

### Configuration-Driven Design
The extension uses a modular, configuration-driven architecture that makes it easy to add support for new websites:

```javascript
// site-config.js
'example.com': {
  type: 'discussion',           // or 'article'
  selectors: {
    main: '.content-selector',
    comments: '.comments'
  },
  preserveComments: true,
  customExtractor: (selectors) => {
    // Custom extraction logic
  }
}
```

### Core Components

- **`content.js`** - Main content script with extraction logic
- **`site-config.js`** - Site-specific configuration rules
- **`reading-mode.css`** - Clean, responsive styling
- **`manifest.json`** - Extension configuration

## Development

### Adding New Site Support

1. Add configuration to `site-config.js`:
   ```javascript
   'newsite.com': {
     type: 'article',  // or 'discussion'
     selectors: { main: '.article-content' },
     preserveComments: false
   }
   ```

2. Test on the target website
3. Refine selectors and add custom extraction logic if needed

### Development Principles

This project follows specific development principles documented in [`DEVELOPMENT_PRINCIPLES.md`](./DEVELOPMENT_PRINCIPLES.md), including:

- Configuration-driven architecture
